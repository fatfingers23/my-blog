You may have heard of the "10Â¢" ch32v003 making waves in the past year. 
I bought a dev board recently when I found out all you need is the MCU, a couple of capacitors, and you have a cheap device you can write Rust for!
[This article](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-CH32V003-Development-Board-10-Cent-Devoard-for/) is what really kicked it off for me. 
When I saw you could easily make your own dev board and hand soldered the MCU pretty easily I was hooked. In this article I want to give you everything you need to know to get started
with writing Rust on these little devices.

# About the chip
The ch32v003 is probably the smallest device I've ever written code for, both resource and physical size. Coming in with 16kb of flash, 2kb of ram, and a RISC-V clock of 48Mhz. But don't let
the lower specs fool you, this thing can do a lot for it's low price. With it, you have access to UART, I2C, SPI, ADC pins, and [more](https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V003.html)

Although I keep labeling it "The 10 cent microcontroller", I've yet to find any that cheap unless you buy thousands of units.
At this point I think it's just what it's known for. Realistically you are looking at 20-30 cents depending on the package. 
This chip comes in 4 different packages. TSSOP20, QFN20, SOP16, and SOP8. All of them but the QFN20 look to be easily enough to hand solder with some skill.

# Requirements for Rust ðŸ¦€
Before you start writing Rust on this little device you do need to buy a few different things as well as setup. Before you click
checkout make sure to read both [Dev board](#dev-board) and [Debugger Module(WCH-LinkE)](#debugger-modulewch-linke) because there are a few gotchas to watch for.

## Dev board
Before I dived into making my own boards with this chip I wanted to order some dev boards to try out the [ch32-hal](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal).
I bought this [dev board from AliExpress ($2.50)](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804778040328.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.92.5d9e1802ATri3e&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa). So far it's been good! Not used to the double headers for breadboards, but just been plugging jumper wires directly into the headers.

I also have the [nanoCh32v003 Dev board($1.50)](https://www.tindie.com/products/johnnywu/nanoch32v003-development-board/) on the way. I'm thinking I am 
going to like this one a bit better cause of the single row of headers.

Both come with:
* the optional 24Mhz crystal oscillator
* USB-C Powered (or can be powered by the WCH-Link)
* Physical reset button
* On board LED
* All pins exposed on the breakout including the single wire debug pin

Also, nothing is stopping you from just [building your own](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-CH32V003-Development-Board-10-Cent-Devoard-for/).

## Debugger Module(WCH-LinkE)
This chip does require a probe to program it. The ch32v003 does not support USB even though both of the dev boards I listed have USB-C ports. There has been some
cool projects to add [USB support though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-QazXghkLY). For this we are going to use the WCH-LinkE. 

![Wch linl](https://img.wch.cn/20230403/0d0e0935-df8f-46e0-825d-03883fa2e6ff.png)

Make sure to note the E when buying these, if you buy a non E version you will need
to update the firmware via the [WCH-LinkUtility](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/wch-linkutility_zip.html). Which it still works, just needs a Windows pc to run the update utility to the latest release.
Which you can do by following the directions in [6.2 of the user manual](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCH-LinkUserManual_PDF.html).

If you do pick up the[nanoch32v003 from tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/johnnywu/nanoch32v003-development-board/) there is an option to get both
for $6.50.

# Software setup
As with most of my posts, we are not going to be writing anything groundbreaking. I just want to get you started and give you the tools to make awesome projects. 
- Install rust using https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- [wlink](https://github.com/ch32-rs/wlink) a rust CLI for interacting with the WCH-LinkE.
- [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal-template) for using the [ch32-hal-template](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal-template)

# Setting up the WCH-LinkE
TODO: Show how to wire the debugger with both ribbon and just the 3 wires (power, gnd, and debug)
TODO: Talk about how you can have logging and flash software with just 3 and dont need the ribbion
TODO: Make sure to say which pin is SWD. I think it's PD1?
TODO: Make sure to take a lot of different pictures of how its wired
TODO: Test to see if you need the reset wire to do like wlink reset. Looks like just the 3 wires. No rst needed

# Getting started with ch32-hal
Talk about this post https://noxim.xyz/blog/rust-ch32v003/
Show how to setup the project from cargo generate and talk about which port is the LED. Note the devboard and nanos LED
Talk about how i use the multi meter to find the port?


# "Unbricking" your chip

Talk about how I accidentally "bricked" it with setting PD1 as a gpio.
Share this video as thanks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHotTF5jvg 
and explain how to in the WCH Utility


# The good, The Okay, and The 2kb's of SRAM

talk about how i've enjoyed it and issues with SPI not working and how i dont think framebuffer embddedd graphic implementations will not work
TLDR great device, does a lot, but don't forget what it is
