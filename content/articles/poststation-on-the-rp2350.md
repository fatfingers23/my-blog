Ever wish getting or sending data to an embedded device was as easy as sending a web request? 
Well now you can with [Poststation](https://poststation.rs/)! Just like a post office handles communications, 
Poststation handles the communication between a host device running a full OS and an embedded device running Rust.
Poststation lets you focus on building the project you have in mind instead of building the tools to build teh project.


In this blog post we are going to explore Poststation by building a Rust program that runs on your computer that uses Poststation to send your computer usage
to a Pico 2 displaying the usage on SSD1306.

# Postcard, Postcard-rpc, and Poststation
Before we get started I wanted to break down some of the different components that make up the Postcard ecosystem. You can also check out [this excellent explanation](https://onevariable.com/poststation-book/family.html).

## [Postcard](https://docs.rs/Postcard/latest/Postcard/)
From the projects [README](https://github.com/jamesmunns/Postcard)
> Postcard is a #![no_std] focused serializer and deserializer for Serde.

Postcard is the underlying data structure. Think of it kind of like JSON or XML, but optimized to be easy to serialize and deserialize on embedded devices where resources can be limited.
If you're curious about more of how it works then I recommend checking out [The Postcard Wire Specification](https://postcard.jamesmunns.com/intro). 
But for this blog post to keep it simple just know that this is the specification of how the data that is sent between the microcontroller and our Host application.

## Postcard-rpc
From the projects [README](https://github.com/jamesmunns/postcard-rpc)
> A host (PC) and client (MCU) library for handling RPC-style request-response types.

To keep to a web analogy where Postcard is JSON or XML, Postcard-rpc is the web server, as well has the web framework.
Postcard-rpc gives you everything you need to set up communications between the Host and the microcontroller. Like handling the transporting of the data via USB, TCP, I2C, UART, etc.
As well as giving you the framework to build handlers on both the microcontroller and the host to receive and send requests that are serialized with Postcard.
The graphic on [Postcard-rpc's doc.rs page](https://docs.rs/postcard-rpc/latest/postcard_rpc/) does a great job of showing how it all works together.

## Poststation
Poststation takes care of the host side of Postcard-rpc and just lets you focus on just writing the logic you need for your project.
No need to worry about how to send data back and forth, how to handle multiple devices, connects/disconnect, It all Just Worksâ„¢.

Poststation is a TUI program that runs right in your terminal and allows you to interact with your microcontroller.

![A picture of the Poststation UI running](./article-assets/7/poststation_ui.webp)

Some of the features are:
* UI Display of your connected devices with info and their status
* A section to see the logs from your device
* [Endpoints](https://docs.rs/postcard-rpc/latest/postcard_rpc/#endpoints) section to see the postcard-rpc endpoints (Works similar to url routes). Can view the request and response types here as well
* [Topics](https://docs.rs/postcard-rpc/latest/postcard_rpc/#topics) are similar to Endpoints but do not expect a response, can also see teh request types here
* History and tracing to help troubleshoot
* And all of this is accessible via a web api! Can use the [poststation-cli](https://crates.io/crates/poststation-cli) to try it out.

There's a lot more to Poststation, but that's the general introduction for what we need to know for the purpose of this post.
To learn more thought can check out these links:
* [poststation-util repo](https://github.com/OneVariable/poststation-util) - Source code of the cli tool, templates to get started, and examples
* [poststation-book](https://onevariable.com/poststation-book/) - Will go into much more details about Poststation as well as detailed getting started guides
* [The Embedded Buddy System by SDR Podcast](https://sdr-podcast.com/episodes/the-embedded-buddy-system/)

Unlike the other projects Poststation is a paid for closed source project, __BUT__ you can [download it](https://poststation.rs/download/) today and use it as
a limited trial and be able to follow along with this post. I can't recommend buying it enough. A one time payment and is valid for all `v0.x` and `v1.x` versions. No yearly subscription, buy it once and it's yours. [You can buy it here](https://onevariable.lemonsqueezy.com/)

# Requirements

## Software
- Install rust using https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- [Picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools/releases/tag/v2.1.0-0) to flash the firmware (Make sure the Pico tool binary is in your path)
  - If you have any issues can also use [elf2uf2-rs](https://crates.io/crates/elf2uf2-rs)
- [Poststation](https://poststation.rs/download/)
- [poststation-cli](https://crates.io/crates/poststation-cli) We use this in a script for resetting to BOOTSEL to flash firmware changes
- [Projects Repo](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor) This is the finished repo for the project

## Hardware
Poststation works with a lot of Microcontrollers, but for this post we are using the RP2350.
- A Pico 2, or any other RP2350 device
  - This can also work with the Pico/RP2040 with a few changes, I may release another branch with this(especially if someone let me know they would like that example)
- A SSD1306 OLED display. These are the cheap little I2c displays you can find on various online retailers. If this project we are using the 128x64 variant 
- Optional, but I found this cute little [3D printed case](https://makerworld.com/en/models/817832#profileId-760400) that looks like a TV. 


# Setup
 The wiring is pretty simple just 4 wires to connect. We power both the pico and screen from USB since we're using it to communicate to the Host program 

| Wireing | Pico                   | Screen |
|---------|------------------------|--------|
| 3v3     | 3v3 out, Pin 36        | VDD    |
| GND     | Any GND, I used Pin 38 | GND    |
| SCL     | GPIO 27                | SCL    |
| SCL     | GPIO 26                | SDA    |

The ease of communicating between device and Host that Poststation gives us allows us to work on the project without the need for a Debug Probe, and we can still get logging, firmware flashing without manually resetting to BOOTSEL.

To flash for the first time:
1.  Hold down the BOOTSEL button as you connect the pico to your computer releasing once connected (usually wait for a second or two after connecting)
2.  Inside the `firmware` folder run the script found at `cargo run`. 
3.  After this should be able to open Poststation from your terminal and see the device connected!
4.  To update the firmware you now change the `SERIAL` variable found in [./firmware/scripts/picoboot.sh](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor/blob/main/firmware/scripts/picoboot.sh)
5.  Then run the script. This sends a message via Poststation to the Pico to reboot to bootsel, then starts the building/flashing process
6.  You should now see a screen displaying the Poststation logo waiting on a connection from the host

To run the Host program
1. Make sure Poststation is running, or you can make a copy of [`.env.example`](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor/blob/main/host/.env.example), rename to `.env` and set the `POSTSTATION_LOCATION` variable to your poststation binary location. Mileage may vary on this feature, make sure to check the logs if you have issues
2. Then just run `cargo run` in side of the `host` folder

That should be it! You should now see your computer usage on the device

# Project Breakdown
A quick order of operations to show how everything Interacts

1. The pico boots to the firmware then connects to Poststation that is running on your computer via USB.
2. When you start the Host program it uses the [poststation-sdk crate](https://crates.io/crates/poststation-sdk) to get a list of connected devices via a JSON web request and selects the first connected device
3. Once selected it makes another JSON web request to Poststation with the computer usage from the [sys-info crate](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)
4. Poststation then does it's magic and routes that to the device via it's serial number
5. On the Pico a postcard-rpc handler runs and displays the usage on the display

The only code you have to write was 2,3,and 5. Just the bare minimal to pick a device and then the logic for getting the usage from the computer, then displaying it on the Pico.
That's the power of Poststation, just focus on your project with an easy to use API for communications. It Just Worksâ„¢.

To start a new project you can also copy the template and build from there. [That is found here](https://github.com/OneVariable/poststation-util/tree/main/templates)

To go a bit deeper I am going to break down each of the crates in this project and their role

## icd Crate
This crate is shared between the firmware and host crate. This is really when the Postcard ecosystem shines in my opinion. Because of this crate
you can share models and endpoints between the two, you have teh same types in all your projects!

For example the struct we use to send the usage is this 
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Schema)]
pub struct SysInfo<'a> {
    pub host_name: &'a str,
    pub cpu_freq_text: &'a str,
    pub cpu_usage: u8,
    pub memory_usage: u64,
    pub total_memory: u64,
    pub scroll_text: &'a str,
}
```

Since this is in the icd crate it's the same data type you send from the Host as you receive on the firmware

This also holds the definitions for Postcard-rpc's endpoints and topics that are defined in macros and styled with a Markdown table like syntax. If you wanted to see what it was like to add a new one can check [this commit](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor/commit/c6c558b236677c2c7b1604556815e60ee564da6a#diff-9287339c0ff308b980d5d4ab4113eb37b405d9414df380f9320facacfa56a8a1R47)
```rust 
// Endpoints spoken by our device
//
// GetUniqueIdEndpoint is mandatory, the others are examples
endpoints! {
    list = ENDPOINT_LIST;
    | EndpointTy                | RequestTy     | ResponseTy            | Path                          |
    | ----------                | ---------     | ----------            | ----                          |
    | GetUniqueIdEndpoint       | ()            | u64                   | "poststation/unique_id/get"   |
    | RebootToPicoBoot          | ()            | ()                    | "template/picoboot/reset"     |
    | SleepEndpoint             | SleepMillis   | SleptMillis           | "template/sleep"              |
    | SetLedEndpoint            | LedState      | ()                    | "template/led/set"            |
    | GetLedEndpoint            | ()            | LedState              | "template/led/get"            |
    | SetDisplayEndpoint        | SysInfo<'a>       | ()                | "template/display/set"        |
}

// incoming topics handled by our device
topics! {
    list = TOPICS_IN_LIST;
    direction = TopicDirection::ToServer;
    | TopicTy                   | MessageTy     | Path              |
    | -------                   | ---------     | ----              |
}

// outgoing topics handled by our device
topics! {
    list = TOPICS_OUT_LIST;
    direction = TopicDirection::ToClient;
    | TopicTy                   | MessageTy     | Path              | Cfg                           |
    | -------                   | ---------     | ----              | ---                           |
}

```

## Firmware Crate
The firmware crate is written using [embassy-rs](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy).

### app.rs
[app.rs](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor/blob/main/firmware/src/app.rs) defines our local firmware application

Context is what holds shared state and our peripherals. This is passed to handlers and how they can access things like turning on the LED or writing text to the screen.

```rust
/// Context contains the data that we will pass (as a mutable reference)
/// to each endpoint or topic handler
pub struct Context {
    /// We'll use this unique ID to identify ourselves to the poststation
    /// server. This should be unique per device.
    pub unique_id: u64,
    pub led: Output<'static>,
    pub display: Ssd1306Async<
        I2CInterface<I2cDevice<'static, NoopRawMutex, I2c<'static, I2C1, i2c::Async>>>,
        DisplaySize128x64,
        ssd1306::mode::BufferedGraphicsModeAsync<DisplaySize128x64>,
    >,
}
```

The rest is set up for Postcard-rpc. All of this is usually the same as the template expect we do defined what handler is called when an endpoint is called.
This of this as a web router defining which web controller(handler) to call. Since we are using embassy and the async version of the ssd1306 crate we use the `aync` kind for `SetDisplayEndPoint` 
```rust
    endpoints: {
        // This list comes from our ICD crate. All of the endpoint handlers we
        // define below MUST be contained in this list.
        list: ENDPOINT_LIST;

        | EndpointTy                | kind      | handler                       |
        | ----------                | ----      | -------                       |
        | GetUniqueIdEndpoint       | blocking  | unique_id                     |
        | RebootToPicoBoot          | blocking  | picoboot_reset                |
        | SleepEndpoint             | spawn     | sleep_handler                 |
        | SetLedEndpoint            | blocking  | set_led                       |
        | GetLedEndpoint            | blocking  | get_led                       |
        | SetDisplayEndpoint        | async     | set_screen_text               |
    };
```

### handlers.rs
[handlers.rs](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor/blob/main/firmware/src/handlers.rs) is where we write our actual logic that we want to run when sending or receiving events via Poststation
In a web world, this would be our web controller that handles GETs,POSTS,etc requests.

Notice how some like the `picoboot_reset` handler that we use to reboot to BOOTSEL are blocking and do not have a return type or take a request.
```rust
/// Also a BLOCKING handler
pub fn picoboot_reset(_context: &mut Context, _header: VarHeader, _arg: ()) {
    embassy_rp::rom_data::reboot(0x0002, 500, 0x0000, 0x0000);
    loop {
        // Wait for reset...
        compiler_fence(Ordering::SeqCst);
    }
}
```

Where others like the `set_led` can take a request `LedState`
```rust
/// Also a BLOCKING handler
pub fn set_led(context: &mut Context, _header: VarHeader, arg: LedState) {
    match arg {
        LedState::Off => context.led.set_low(),
        LedState::On => context.led.set_high(),
    }
}
```
or like `get_led` can return a request back to the host

```rust

pub fn get_led(context: &mut Context, _header: VarHeader, _arg: ()) -> LedState {
    match context.led.is_set_low() {
        true => LedState::Off,
        false => LedState::On,
    }
}
```

You can also pull peripherals from the context like in the `set_screen_text` handler. Notice how the request it receives is the `SysInfo` struct we defined in the icd crate. 
```rust
pub async fn set_screen_text<'a>(context: &mut Context, _header: VarHeader, arg: SysInfo<'a>) {
    context.display.clear_buffer();

    let buffer = &mut [0u8; 1024];
    let mut cursor = Cursor::new(buffer);

    let _ = write!(
        &mut cursor,
        "{}\nCPU:{} {}% \nRam:{}/{}\n\n{}",
        arg.host_name,
        arg.cpu_freq_text,
        arg.cpu_usage,
        arg.memory_usage,
        arg.total_memory,
        arg.scroll_text
    );
    Text::with_baseline(cursor.as_str(), Point::zero(), TEXT_STYLE, Baseline::Top)
        .draw(&mut context.display)
        .unwrap();
    let _ = context.display.flush().await;
}

```

## main.rs
[main.rs](https://github.com/fatfingers23/pico-pc-performance-monitor/blob/main/firmware/src/main.rs) is pretty much the same as the template, when starting a new project you can mostly leave this the same.
But do need to define and pass in what you need to the context
```rust
    //Setup the I2c bus to connect to the SSD1306 display
    let i2c = I2c::new_async(p.I2C1, p.PIN_27, p.PIN_26, Irqs, i2c::Config::default());
    static I2C_BUS: StaticCell<I2c1Bus> = StaticCell::new();
    let i2c_bus = I2C_BUS.init(Mutex::new(i2c));

    // Set up for the SSD1206 display
    let i2c_dev = I2cDevice::new(i2c_bus);
    let interface = I2CDisplayInterface::new(i2c_dev);
    let mut display = Ssd1306Async::new(interface, DisplaySize128x64, DisplayRotation::Rotate0)
        .into_buffered_graphics_mode();
    let display_init_result = display.init().await;
    
    ...
   

    let context = app::Context {
        unique_id,
        led,
        display,
    };

```

The [`shared_bus.rs`](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/main/examples/rp23/src/bin/shared_bus.rs) example in the embassy-rs repo is a great resource to see an example of spi or just a regular i2c bus
